Gerard Braad's dotfiles using `git`, `stow`, and `zsh`
======================================================

!["Prompt"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbraad/assets/gh-pages/icons/prompt-icon-64.png)

These are my dotfiles that I use for dall my workstation and developement environments on a daily basis. I share it because I got frustrated about moving a tarball around (and being scared of losing it). This eventually happened when my notebook got stolen... so, this is not an ideal solution for you. Treat it as, "what you see is what it is"...
